DESCRIPTIONS
------------
o The "modules" directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. Things like mixin
  declarations, functions, and variables.

o The "partials" directory is where the meat of my CSS is constructed. A lot of folks like to break their stylesheets
  into header, content, sidebar, and footer components (and a few others). As I'm more of a SMACSS guy myself, I like
  to break things down into much finer categories (typography, buttons, textboxes, selectboxes, etcâ€¦).

o The vendor directory is for third-party CSS. This is handy when using prepackaged components developed by other
  people (or for your own components that are maintained in another project). jQuery UI and a color picker are examples
  of CSS that you might want to place in the vendor directory. As a general rule I make it a point not to modify files
  in my vendor directory. If I need to make modifications I add those after the vendored files are included in my
  primary stylesheet. This should make it easy for me to update my third-party stylesheets to more current versions in
  the future.
